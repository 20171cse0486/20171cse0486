<p>China hoped that India will not put trade restrictions and limit movement of people to the country in the wake of the coronavirus epidemic in its Hubei province.
In an interview to PTI, Chinese Ambassador Sun Weidong said China's foreign ministry and local governments are working hard to ensure the safety of Indians and people working in Indian diplomatic missions in China.
Admitting that there could be a short-term impact of the epidemic on China’s economy, he said the country’s internal resilience is growing and it has ample resources and policy tools to cope with economic volatility.</p>
